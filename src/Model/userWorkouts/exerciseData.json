      "The leg extension is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs. The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine. There are various manufacturers of these machines and each one is slightly different. Most gym and weight rooms will have the machine in their facility. The leg extension is an isolated exercise targeting one specific muscle group, the quadriceps. It should not be considered as a total leg workout, such as the squat or deadlift. The exercise consists of bending the leg at the knee and extending the legs, then lowering them back to the original position."

When in the lower position, the knees point a bit outwards and the movement should be always fluid.<\/p>"

When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.<\/p>\n<p>To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.<\/p>\n<p>As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. More advanced athletes can perform a strict variation of the muscle-up which is done slowly, without any kip. This variation begins with a still dead hang and uses isometric muscle contraction to ascend above the bar in a slow, controlled fashion.<\/p>"

When done on a rowing machine, rowing also exercises muscles that extend and support the legs (quadriceps and thigh muscles). In all cases, the abdominal and lower back muscles must be used in order to support the body and prevent back injury."

The movement starts with the arms straight, and the hands holding weights at the sides or in front of the body. Body is in a slight forward-leaning position with hips and knees bent a little. Arms are kept straight or slightly bent, and raised through an arc of movement in the coronal plane that terminates when the hands are at approximately shoulder height. Weights are lowered to the starting position, completing one rep. When using a cable machine the individual stands with the coronal plane in line with the pulley, which is at or near the ground.[9] The exercise can be completed one shoulder at a time (with the other hand used to stabilize the body against the weight moved), or with both hands simultaneously if two parallel pulleys are available."
